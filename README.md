## Project Overview

Our mission is to develop a comprehensive and user-friendly application that supersedes unofficial platforms for second-hand sales, donations, borrowing, and related activities, such as the popular Bilkent İtaraf ediyor. Our vision is to provide a singular platform that seamlessly integrates all these functionalities to enhance user convenience and satisfaction.

## Key Features to Prioritize

1. **Bilkent Email Authentication**: To ensure the authenticity of users and maintain a secure environment, our app will require Bilkent email verification.

2. **Search and Filtering**: Users will enjoy a powerful search and filtering system that allows them to easily find items of interest. They can also save items to their favorites for quick access.

3. **Buyer/Seller Chats**: Our platform will facilitate direct communication between buyers and sellers, promoting transparency and efficient transactions.

4. **User Profiles**: Users can create personalized profiles to manage their activities and build trust within the community.

5. **Product Reviews**: We will implement a review system, enabling users to share feedback on products. Reviews will only be allowed after a purchase, ensuring credibility.

6. **Lost and Found Wall**: A dedicated space for lost and found items will be available to assist users in reuniting with their belongings.

7. **Rent/Borrow/Donations**: Our app will accommodate various transaction types, including renting, borrowing, and donating items.

8. **Online Payment Interface**: We will integrate a secure online payment gateway to facilitate transactions and enhance user convenience.

9. **Multilingual Support**: Our application will support both English and Turkish languages to cater to a diverse user base.

10. **Image Upload**: Users can easily upload images of their items to enhance listings and attract potential buyers.

11. **Reporting Functionality**: To maintain a safe environment, users will be able to report suspicious activities, be it from buyers or sellers.

12. **Tagging System**: Sellers can add tags to their listings, and buyers can request items using tags (e.g., course codes). Users can also subscribe to email notifications based on tags of interest. Admin will manage tags.

13. **Ad Featuring**: We will provide options for users to promote their listings for increased visibility.

14. **Post Metrics**: Sellers can track the performance of their listings through detailed post metrics.

## Optional Features to Consider

1. **Bidding**: Implementing a bidding system for items could add an exciting dimension to the platform.

2. **Product Requests**: Users can request specific products through a global forum, supported by spam filtering and a moderating bot or tag system (e.g., books/courses).

3. **Seller-Defined Tags**: Allow sellers to create custom tags for their listings to improve discoverability. These tags will still require verification

4. **Image Moderation**: Implement image moderation to ensure appropriate content.

Our application aims to revolutionize the way users engage in second-hand transactions, donations, and borrowing by offering a robust and user-friendly platform. We are committed to continuously enhancing the user experience and fostering a secure and thriving community.
